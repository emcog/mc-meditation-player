\u2022 self-awareness and self-acceptance,
\u2022 focusing attention on sensations of breathing to reduce mental activity,
\u2022 grounding awareness in the body.
 Use this recording to practice stopping and starting again several times a day.

These feelings are the glue of our relationships and without them we are disconnected from each other. Many of us have learnt to spend so much of our lives in our heads that we have become disconnected from our feelings. This is why we need to practice the bodyscan. When you get the idea of how it goes, practice it for longer periods without the recording. In time you will find feelings returning to your body, like colour returning to your emotional life.

Sitting upright and awake, breathing, is a simple practice but challenging and it takes effort \u2013 just a little effort at a time \u2013 too much effort will just cause tension and feeds patterns of striving for goals.
